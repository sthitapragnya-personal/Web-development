// without using var also we are getting the required output.

// here the n is capital
firstName="sthita";

// use a varible
console.log(firstName);

//change the value
// but here the n is small so it became another new varible
firstname="shubham";

console.log(firstName);

console.log(firstname);


// so here js gives us a lot of relaxation regarding the declaration of the varibles but it sometimes creates prblms for the developers so we use  "use strict" mode . and we will see this in 5.html and 5.js
