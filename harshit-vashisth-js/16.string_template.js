// string template
//-------------------------

let age=22;
let firstname="sthita";

// "my name is sthita and my age is 22"
let me="my name is "+firstname+" amd my age is "+age;// it is a very tedious job
console.log(me);


// so we will now see the use of backticks ``.
let x=`my name is ${firstname} and my age is ${age}`;
 x=`my name is ${firstname} and my age is ${age}`;
console.log(x);
