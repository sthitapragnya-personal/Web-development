//introduction to varibles

// variables are used to store information
//we can use that information later
// we can change that information later

// declare a varible
// here there is nothing int , float , string etc, there is only 
// var.
var firstname="sthita";

// use a varible
console.log(firstname);

//change the value
firstname="shubham";

console.log(firstname);

//we can also again declare the same variable and then change it's
// value

var firstname="satyam";
console.log(firstname);
