<!-- 
With the CSS transform property you can use the following 2D transformation methods:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
translate()
rotate()
scaleX()
scaleY()
scale()
skewX()
skewY()
skew()
matrix() // note the matrix() is very difficult to remember so it is mostly prefered to use the w3 schools or any other website for help.


 note : all these 2-d transition properties are applied with the attribute called as transform  but the transform only works with the block level elements and inline-block level elements and do not work with inline elements. -->
